# Arduino Lab Homework
In this folder I publish all the code I have written for "Introduction to Robotics" course.

[Laboratory 2-PotentiometersColorRED](https://github.com/IordachescuAnca/Introduction-to-Robotics/tree/master/Lab-Homework/PotentiometersColorRED): Controlling the RGB colors using 3 potentiometers.

[Laboratory 3-KnockDetection](https://github.com/IordachescuAnca/Introduction-to-Robotics/tree/master/Lab-Homework/KnockDetection): Detecting knocks using a passive buzzer. Five seconds afer knock, start a tone using an active buzzer. The tone can be stopped pressing the button.
