***Matrix Game***

The Matrix Game that I implemented is called Tetris.

**Description of the project**: The purpose of the game is destroying lines of block before it reaches the top. There are four-connected blocks that will fall down and the player has to choose the rotation that create lines that fill the box horizontally, this will clear the lines of blocks.

**Requirements**:
- *Score*: Every time a line of blockes is cleared, the score increases by 8(numbers of blockes that are on a line) multiplied by the level the player has reached.
- *Levels*: The game it has 3 levels: easy, medium and hard.
- *Progress*: is represented by speed. From the easy level to hard level it will increase the speed.
- *Lives*: The player has 3 lives. It has the chance to play the game without resetting the score until it loses all his lives.
- *HighScore*: The highscore and the player that reached the highscore will be kept in memory. It can be reset by pushing a button.
- *Animation*: When the game is started it is displayed a demo of the game. When the player wins, it will displayed a smiley face, else it will be displayed a sad face.
